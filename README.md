# 💳 Loan Default Analysis | End-to-End Power BI Solution  

🚀 Project Completed: Loan Default Analysis | Power BI Dashboard 🎉  
I’m excited to share my **end-to-end BI solution** where I analyzed loan default risks, applicant profiles, and financial trends.

## 🔎 Project Overview  
The goal of this project was to help financial institutions **identify risk patterns** and **understand borrower behavior**.  

Key objectives:  
- 📊 Visualized **loan default trends** across time and regions  
- 👤 Analyzed **borrower demographics & financial profiles**  
- 🏦 Built a **Financial Risk Matrix** to assess default probabilities  
- 📈 Created **interactive dashboards** for decision-makers

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used  
- **Microsoft SQL Server** → Data ingestion & preprocessing (250,000+ records)  
- **Excel** → Initial validation and dataset checks  
- **Power Query Editor** → ETL, cleaning, and shaping  
- **Power BI Desktop** → Dashboard design and measures  
- **Power BI Service** → Dataflows, publishing, and refresh scheduling  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** → KPIs, risk calculations, custom metrics  
- **Standard Mode Gateway** → Secure data connectivity  

---

## 📊 Visualizations in Report  
- 📈 **Line Charts** – Loan trends over time  
- 🧩 **Decomposition Tree** – Drill down into key risk drivers  
- 🎗 **Ribbon Chart** – Ranking shifts in loan categories  
- 📉 **Area Charts** – Default % over time  
- 🍩 **Donut Charts** – Loan type and repayment distribution  
- 📋 **Tables & Cards** – KPI snapshots (Total Loans, Default %, Risk Scores)  

---

## ✨ Dashboard Highlights  
- 📂 Built on a **large, complex dataset** (250K+ entries)  
- 🔎 Provided **multiple perspectives**: borrower, financial institution, regional trends  
- 🧮 Advanced filtering powered by **ALLEXCEPT & CALCULATE** in DAX  
- ⏰ **Scheduled & incremental refreshes** for near real-time reporting
